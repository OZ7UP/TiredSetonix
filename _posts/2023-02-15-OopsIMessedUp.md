Just a quick, unedited post.

In case you haven't noticed, there are some serious problems going on with Version 1.5 of my website. The Pagination function has essentially stopped working, which means the front page will just keep on going without end. In addition, the tag function has also malfunctioned, leaving it a bit of a mess.

Well, at least it's still somewhat functional, which is more than I can say for Pagination.

It's still a fun learning experience, though, so I'm not going to complain.

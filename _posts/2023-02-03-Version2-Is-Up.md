QUOKKAS ARE AWESOME!

Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, I’ve pretty much rebuilt the website, not entirely from scratch, but rather by pulling together the various things that I needed and using a terminal to turn all that into something cohesive. I’m still using the same theme as the last time.

What I intend to do next is to port the repository over to codespaces so that if I need to make any new changes to the code behind the code, I can actually make the updates and push them through properly. For some reason, the virtual machine that I used doesn’t seem to be able to push through any changes remotely.

Well, I can at least use that virtual machine to set everything up, and then use codespaces to do the post-deployment upgrades.

Another unedited post to share.

Naturally, I'm still a bit ticked off that I can't figure out how exactly the pagination code for this website is broken. It's still working fine for Version 1 as well as that for the Roseburn  Avenue website.

I suspect that the issue might be linked to how I compiled Verion 1.5 in the first place. Version 1 was forked directly from the "Beautiful Jekyll" repository, whereas this was created and installed via the command line interface on a virtual machine.

Anyway, while this doesn't exactly solve the pagination problem, if you want to look for a certain post but don't want to scroll all the way down, just use look up the year using the search function. Of course, if you know what tag you're looking for, feel free to use thag function too. At least it's not completely borked.

As for other news, our latest Roseburn Avenue project has been completed for over a week now. Due to the nature of the reason we chose to work on this particular song, we are not able to publically release it for another week.

I can't wait to see how the fandom that the song is connected to will react.

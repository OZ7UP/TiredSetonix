I’ve managed to resolve the problem with pagination for this website. As it turned out, there was a second index file (in the markdown format) which was already clashing with the pre-existing index html file.

One quick removal later, and everything’s been resolved.

I’ll be leaving up my previous posts on the matter for learning purposes.

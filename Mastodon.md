## Mastodon Exclusives

### What’s with this page?

Long story short, if you’re following me on Mastodon, there’ll be times when I feel like sharing stuff with just you, and not with the rest of the Fediverse.

Basically, think of it as a way of me thanking you for following me.

Of course, as with the downloads page, there’s nothing stopping you from sharing the link to this particular page. For the time being, I’m not particularly interested in locking away exclusive content behind a membership page, or anything that requires you to sign up for something. It wouldn’t be fair for you all, especially because I’m just a normal bloke.

With that said, it’d be nice if we could keep this amongst ourselves.

## CHECK BACK SOON!

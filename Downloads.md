From time to time, I will occasionally put things up for upload on this special page. These may range from original music pieces to special wallpaper packs.

I will remove these links from this page, but the files themselves will remain accessible if you bookmark them ahead of time.

Unlike my favourite Japanese celebrities, these files will remain free of charge to access. All you have to do is to follow me on [Mastodon](https://famichiki.jp/@RBurn_Ave_Zach){:target="_blank"} to stay up to date with what's available.

## 26th February 2023 - 13th March 2023: "Jamming By The Sea" (written late 2017)

You can [download this music track for free](/downloads/JammingByTheSeaSept2021remaster.m4a). 

I wrote this song back towards the end of 2017 back home in Naarm (Melbourne), shortly after my second trip to Japan. On this particular trip, I was visiting Toyoma Prefecture on the west coast of the country, and one of the things I wanted to do was to check out the town of Himi because of a special ramen that was available there. This involved taking a local train along the seaside, and some of the pictures I took ended up inspiring this song.
